# Simple Neural Network in NumPy

This repository contains a Python implementation of a simple neural network using NumPy, designed to illustrate the basics of neural network architecture, forward and backward propagation, and the training process.

## Repository Structure

- `notebook/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations and step-by-step code execution.
  - `neuralnetwork.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook illustrating the neural network implementation.
- `source/`: Contains the source code for the neural network.
  - `neural.py`: Core script with the neural network implementation.
- `myenv/`: The directory that could contain a virtual environment or configurations specific to this project.
- `.gitignore`: Defines what files and directories Git should ignore.
- `LICENSE`: The license file specifying how the code can be used.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview and instructions for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the dependencies needed to run the neural network.

## Installation

To set up the environment to run the neural network, you need to install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install the required versions of NumPy and Matplotlib.

## Usage

To run the neural network, navigate to the `source` directory and execute the `neural.py` script:

```bash
python neural.py
```

Alternatively, you can explore the `neuralnetwork.ipynb` notebook inside the `notebook` directory to interact with the code and learn more about the implementation details.

## Neural Network Implementation Steps

1. **Loading the Dataset**: The input (`X`) and output (`y`) data are loaded into the system.

2. **Architecture Setup**: The neural network's structure is defined, including the number of neurons in the input, hidden, and output layers.

3. **Weight Initialization**: Initial random weights are set for the connections between the layers.

4. **Forward Propagation**: The network processes the input data and generates predictions.

5. **Backward Propagation**: The network adjusts its weights based on the error in its predictions.

6. **Training**: The process of forward and backward propagation is repeated for a number of epochs to train the model.

## Visualizing Training Progress

The training process can be visualized by plotting the error reduction over epochs, showing how the model improves its predictions over time.
